# CatchMeIfYouCan:  An Eye-cercise Game 

## Inspiration

In the digital age, our lives revolve around screens - from smartphones to laptops, our eyes are constantly engaged, leading to increased instances of eye fatigue and strain. When eye doctors recommend doing eye exercises, people often feel reluctant and lead to oblivion. Recognizing the need for a solution that is both effective and engaging, we were inspired to create "Catch Me If You Can." This project stems from the desire to blend eye health with technology, specifically targeting the prevalent issue of eye strain in a way that's enjoyable and easy to integrate into daily routines.

## Our solution
The intention of the project is to gamify eye exercises, making the mundane task of alleviating eye fatigue a fun and interactive experience. Users are prompted to follow a moving dot, visualized as a playful ball. These movements are tailored to address common symptoms of eye strain, encouraging users to engage in practices that promote eye healthcare and mental healthcare, such as looking away from the screen, focusing on distant objects, and following movements that stretch and relax the eye muscles.

## How it works
Catch Me If You Can incorporates a blend of modern web technologies and game design principles. We carefully designed the user experience to provide a game that's both beneficial for eye health and engaging. With HTML, JavaScript, the Webgazer library, and Python, we crafted a dynamic interface where a ball bounces around the screen in various patterns, prompting users to perform a range of eye exercises.

## How to run

- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the repository directory.
- Set up a virtual environment. To do this, you can typically run these two commands:
  - `python3 -m venv venv`
  - `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install Flask in your virtual environment with `pip install Flask`.
- Run `app.py` using Python 3 with the command `python3 app.py`.
- Navigate to localhost in your web browser to start playing the game.
- Use your eye and voice to catch the ball!

## Citing

This project relies on the `WebGazer.js` library for real-time eye-tracking in the browser. More details about this library can be found [here](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/).
